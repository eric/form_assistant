h1. FormAssistant

This is a Rails plugin that essentially provides two form builder's:

* @RPH::FormAssistant::FormBuilder@
** Provides a couple new form helpers in addition to a method_missing hook that allows content to be wrapped in HTML elements "on the fly". Also, all form helpers have labels attached to them automatically.
* @RPH::FormAssistant::InlineErrorFormBuilder@
** Extends @RPH::FormAssistant::FormBuilder@ to attach field errors to the field itself, avoiding the need for the other option: @<%= error_messages_for :object %>@

Once installed, it's easy to use either form builder via the following methods:

<pre><code><% form_assistant_for @project do |form| %>
  // typical form_for stuff
<% end %>

<% inline_error_form_assistant_for @project do |form| %>
  // typical form_for stuff
<% end %>
</code></pre>

That's all you have to do. If you don't think you'll be using the regular form assistant on one form, and the inline error form assistant on another, you can set which default builder to use across your entire application like so:

<pre><code>ActionView::Base.default_form_builder = RPH::FormAssistant::FormBuilder
ActionView::Base.default_form_builder = RPH::FormAssistant::InlineErrorFormBuilder
</code></pre>

The @InlineErrorFormBuilder@ uses partials to style the fields with and without errors, which is an extremely flexible way to keep your forms DRY. The form partials are kept in app/views/forms. To get started, run the following rake task from your project root:

<pre><code>$> rake form_assistant:install</code></pre>

That will put some example form partials in app/views/forms/*.
